## Step 1: Download and Install Bejeweled 3
 
The first step is to download and install the trial version of Bejeweled 3 from PopCap Games' website[^1^]. The trial version will let you play for 60 minutes before asking you to enter an order number. You can also download the game from other sources, such as Steam or Origin, but make sure it is compatible with the patch file we will use later.
 
## Step 2: Download and Extract the Patch File
 
The next step is to download and extract the patch file that will crack Bejeweled 3. You can find the patch file from various websites, such as woofasr[^2^], SoundCloud[^3^] or sway.office.com[^4^]. However, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware. Always scan the files with an antivirus program before opening them.
 
Once you have downloaded the patch file, extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a file named "Bejeweled3.exe" or something similar. This is the cracked executable file that will replace the original one.
 
## Step 3: Replace the Original Executable File
 
The final step is to replace the original executable file of Bejeweled 3 with the cracked one. To do that, you need to locate the folder where you installed Bejeweled 3 on your Mac. The default location is usually "/Applications/Bejeweled 3.app/Contents/MacOS". If you installed the game from Steam or Origin, you may need to find the folder under their respective directories.
 
Once you have found the folder, make a backup copy of the original executable file, just in case something goes wrong. Then, drag and drop the cracked executable file into the folder and overwrite the original one. You may need to enter your administrator password to confirm the action.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy Bejeweled 3
 
Now you are ready to enjoy Bejeweled 3 without any limitations. Launch the game from your desktop or start menu and play any game mode you want. You should not see any order number prompt or countdown timer anymore. Have fun!
