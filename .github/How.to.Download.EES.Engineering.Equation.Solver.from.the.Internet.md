# How to Download EES: Engineering Equation Solver from the Internet
 
EES: Engineering Equation Solver is a software program that can numerically solve thousands of coupled non-linear algebraic and differential equations. It can also be used to solve differential and integral equations, do optimization, provide uncertainty analyses, perform linear and non-linear regression, convert units, check unit consistency, and generate publication-quality plots. EES has a high accuracy thermodynamic and transport property database for hundreds of substances that can be used with the equation solving capability.
